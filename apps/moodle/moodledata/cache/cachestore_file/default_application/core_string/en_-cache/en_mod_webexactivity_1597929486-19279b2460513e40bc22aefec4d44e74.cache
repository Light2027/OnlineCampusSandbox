When you add the WebEx Meeting activity, you define the date and time of the meeting, as well a number of other optional parameters (such as expected duration, a description, etc). Participants (enrolled students) are then able to enter the WebEx meeting by clicking on a "join meeting" link under the activity in Moodle (teachers will see a link that says "host meeting"). If the meeting is recorded, students will be able to view the recording after the meeting is over.
